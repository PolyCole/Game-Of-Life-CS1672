# Game-Of-Life-CS1672

This game is based upon Conway's Game Of Life. The documentation for the original game
can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life

The game uses StdDraw to create a version of Conway's Game Of Life.

The program accepts input through text files in the following format,

Line 1: Width of board
Line 2: Height of board
Rest of file: Board drawn with 0 and 1's. 

For example, a 3x3 board with one live square in the middle would be:

3
3
0 0 0
0 1 0
0 0 0
